## Fix Pass: 2026-06-05

### Phase A — PR Triage

Scanned 29 open `fix/` and `p3-batch/` PRs. One PR met auto-merge criteria:

| PR | Branch | Issues | Action |
|----|--------|--------|--------|
| #302 | fix/issue-299-300-dx-fixes | #299, #300 | **Merged** (squash) after branch update — all CI checks passed |

All remaining open fix-branch PRs carry P1 disposition (no auto-merge ever).

### Phase B — Issue Fixes

| Issue | Priority | Description | PR | Reviewer Feedback Applied | Disposition |
|-------|----------|-------------|-----|---------------------------|-------------|
| #306 | P3 | `indexing.py` `load_index`: bare `except: pass` swallowed MemoryError/KeyboardInterrupt/SystemExit | #309 | Gemini: broadened to `except Exception as e` + warning log | Auto-merge pending CI |
| #307 | P3 | `api.py` `run_indexing`: completion status set outside `_index_lock`; WebSocket broadcast bypassed | #310 | Gemini: call `indexing_progress_callback(100, 100, "Complete")` inside lock before setting `running=False` | Auto-merge pending CI |
| #308 | P3 | `Dockerfile`: runs as root; `chown -R` after `COPY` bloats image layers; port binds to 0.0.0.0 | #311 | Gemini: create `appuser` before COPY, use `COPY --chown=appuser:appuser`, `docker-compose.yml` binds to 127.0.0.1 | Auto-merge pending CI |
| #125 | P1 Critical Bug | `api.py` agentic search: raw dict generator passed to `StreamingResponse` — TypeError on every agentic query | #312 | Gemini: "No review comments" — CodeQL finding at line 1028 is pre-existing, noted on PR | **Awaiting human review** (P1 — never auto-merged) |

### Reviewer Notes

- **PR #309** (BM25 except): Initial fix used `except (OSError, pickle.UnpicklingError, EOFError, ValueError)` — Gemini reviewer correctly identified it missed `AttributeError`/`ImportError`. Broadened to `except Exception as e` with typed warning log.
- **PR #310** (indexing lock): Initial fix moved status updates inside `_index_lock` but bypassed WebSocket broadcast (direct dict mutation). Gemini reviewer caught this. Fixed by calling `indexing_progress_callback(100, 100, "Complete")` inside the lock, which fires `ws_manager.broadcast()` via `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`.
- **PR #311** (Dockerfile): Initial fix placed `adduser`/`chown -R` after `COPY . .`, causing layer bloat and cache invalidation on every source change. Gemini reviewer caught this. Restructured: create user → install deps → `COPY --chown=appuser:appuser . .` → `USER appuser`.
- **PR #309 CI**: First run failed with `test_stream_answer_rerun_search` ERROR (HuggingFace HTTP call not mocked — pre-existing flaky test, unrelated to BM25 fix). Branch updated; re-run in progress.
- **CodeRabbit**: Rate-limited on all four PRs throughout the run — treated as neutral per protocol.

**Summary:** 1 PR merged (Phase A) · 3 PRs opened auto-merge-pending-CI · 1 PR opened awaiting human review (P1) · 0 escalated · 0 skipped
